# 1. This program is part of my pattern of writing wrapper programs
#    that exclude stuff that I usually want to exclude, and naming
#    them by taking the name of the underlying command and repeating
#    its last letter:
#
#        findd
#        grepp
#        tidyy
#
# 2. This program is also an example of using GNU Bash 4's `corpoc`
#    builtin to filter stderr and write its results back out to
#    stderr.
